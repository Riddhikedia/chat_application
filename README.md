Anonymity: Random gc emphasizes anonymity, meaning users are not required to create an account or provide personal information to start a chat. This anonymity can contribute to a sense of freedom and openness in conversations.

Text-based chat: It primarily offers text-based chat, where users can exchange messages with their chat partner in real-time. The chat interface typically includes a text input field to type messages and a display area to view the conversation history.
